## Table Contest Entry

This is my (example) entry for the 2025 Posit Table Contest. The table I made provides weather conditions (temperature and humidity) for the first 10 days of May, 2023 in Gibraltar. I used Great Tables along with a few functions from gt-extras.

I published the table (along with the code to make it) using Posit Connect Cloud: https://richmeister-table-contest-example-entry.share.connect.posit.cloud/.
